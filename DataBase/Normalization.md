Normalization
===========
DataBase normalization is a technique reconstructing the db system effectively. 
By normalizating, we can remove redundancy data. 
-----------
# Necessity
When normalization was not done, three error can occur. 
1. Update
2. Insert
3. Deletion 

## 1-Normalization(1NF)
- All the columns must have the Atomic Value. 


## 2-Normalization(2NF)
- All the columns must satisfy complete funtional dependencu(FD)

## 3-Normalization(3NF)
- All the colums satisfy the transitive rule.
 
## Boyce and Codd Normal Form(BCNF)
- All the determinant are included in the candidate key sets.
